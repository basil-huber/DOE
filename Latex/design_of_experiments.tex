\section{Design of Experiments}

We design the experiment to efficiently determine the influence of the  parameter $a$, $b$, and $d$ on the mean travel time and the mean jerk experienced during the journey.
The complex nature of the problem does not allow to make assumptions on the model underlying the experiments. We therefore choose to investigate several models. We begin with a simple linear model of the form
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	y_a &= a_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i x_i + \varepsilon_a \quad \text{and}\\ 
	y_b &= b_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} b_i x_i + \varepsilon_b,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $y_a$ and $y_b$ are the responses (mean travel time and mean jerk), $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the effects of the $i$th parameter on the travel time and the jerk respectively, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ are the values taken by the parameters A, B and C respectively. Since the results of the analysis suggest that the influence of parameter A on the travel time is negligible (cf. \ref{}), we adjust our model by omitting this parameter.
The nature of the algorithm suggest that interactions could play an important role. Hence, we will also investigate a linear model allowing for interactions between the parameters as described in eq. \ref{eq:model_inter}.
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:model_inter}
\begin{align}
	y_a &= a_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i x_i + \displaystyle\sum_{i,j=1, i \neq j}^{3} a_{ij} x_i x_j + \varepsilon_a \quad \text{and}\\ 
	y_b &= b_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} b_i x_i + \displaystyle\sum_{i,j=1, i \neq j}^{3} b_{ij} x_i x_j + \varepsilon_b
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
As for the linear model, we found that the influence of parameter A and it's interactions is negligible and omit the parameter for the travel time. We also test a quadratic model with the following equations:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:model_inter}
\begin{align}
	y_a &= a_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i x_i + \displaystyle\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} a_{ij} x_i x_j + \varepsilon_a \quad \text{and}\\ 
	y_b &= b_0 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} b_i x_i + \displaystyle\sum_{i,j=1}^{3} b_{ij} x_i x_j + \varepsilon_b,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
which has additionally the quadratic factors $a_{ii}$.
Due to the limited number of experiments, we choose not to test higher order models.
