\section{Introduction}

Quadrotors are cool, bla bla bla


In this work, we try to find a model that allows us to estimated the influence of three parameters of the collision avoidance algorithm on the mean travel time during an experiment and the mean jerk a vehicle is subjected to. Having a good model of the travel time and the jerk will allow us to chose the parameters in order to optimize the algorithm's performance. We fit a linear model, a linear model with interactions and a quadratic model with interactions on the data. We fit the model by optimizing the effects in the sense of least-squares.
We use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the quality of the different models.
