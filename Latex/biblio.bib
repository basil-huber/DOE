	abstract = {This paper presents a cooperative decentralized path-planning algorithm for a group of autonomous agents that provides guaranteed collision-free trajectories in real-time. The algorithm is robust with respect to arbitrary delays in the wireless traffic, possible sources being transmission time and error correction. Agents move on reserved areas which are guaranteed not to intersect, therefore ensuring safety. A handshaking procedure guarantees recent information states for the agents. Conflicts between agents are resolved by a cost-based negotiation process. The basic algorithm is augmented by the introduction of waypoints, which increase performance at the cost of additional wireless traffic. An implementation of the algorithm is tested in simulation and successfully applied to a real system of autonomous robots. The results are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Hazardous collision situations among multiple aircraft could arise in future air transport system more often than today, since traffic density is predicted to hugely increase. An Automatic Conflict Resolution Algorithm is presented in this paper, which can provide automatic aircraft separation assurance for next generation air traffic control systems. Once a conflict arising with one or more aircraft has been detected, the proposed algorithm computes a safe flight trajectory to maintain separation with other traffic. The algorithm has been conceived for installation on-board autonomous aircraft because it performs required decision-making process for conflict detection and generates commands directly to the autopilot for conflict resolution. The algorithm is not rule-based but uses an efficient analytical solution to detect the conflicts, thus resulting suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, the proposed strategy for generating the conflict resolution maneuver minimizes the deviation from the original trajectory. In addition to algorithm description, some numerical simulations with challenging scenarios are presented in the paper, showing algorithm ability to solve a conflict situation in a self-organizing system including several aircraft equipped with the same proposed algorithm.},

This paper focuses on regional variations in commuting trip lengths by calculating minimum (required) commuting distances, along with excess commuting rates. The study contributes to the excess commuting research framework from a regional perspective, both by stressing the specific characteristics of urban networks with overlapping commute areas, and by putting forward an alternative method for calculating spatially disaggregated values. A case study in the north of Belgium shows that large variations in minimum commuting distances occur. This in turn identifies to a large extent opportunities for shrinking commuting distances by influences such as rising fuel prices, compact urban planning, extreme congestion or dissuasive traffic policies.
Resumen
Este artículo se centra en las diferencias regionales en la longitud del desplazamiento hasta el puesto de trabajo, mediante el cálculo de las distancias mínimas de desplazamiento (requeridas), junto con las tasas de desplazamiento en exceso. El estudio contribuye desde una perspectiva regional al corpus de investigación sobre el exceso de desplazamiento al puesto de trabajo, por un lado haciendo hincapié en las características específicas de las redes urbanas que se solapan con áreas dormitorio y por otro proponiendo un método alternativo para calcular los valores espacialmente desagregados. Un estudio de caso sobre el norte de Bélgica muestra la incidencia de grandes diferencias en las distancias mínimas de desplazamiento. Esto identifica a su vez, en gran medida, una serie de oportunidades para la reducción de las distancias de desplazamiento debido a la influencia del aumento en el precio del combustible, la planificación urbanística compacta, atascos de tráfico extremos, o políticas de tráfico disuasorias.},

	doi = {10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152536},
	abstract = {This paper presents ICS-AVOID, a collision avoidance scheme based upon the concept of Inevitable Collision State (ICS), ie a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the robotic system is, a collision eventually occurs. By design, ICS-AVOID can handle dynamic environments since ICS do take into account the future behaviour of moving objects. ICS-AVOID is designed to keep the system away from ICS. By doing so, motion safety is guaranteed (by definition a robotic system in a non-ICS state has at least one collision-free trajectory that it can use). To demonstrate the efficiency of ICS-AVOID, it has been extensively compared with two state-of-the-art collision avoidance schemes: the first one is built upon the Dynamic Window approach and the second one on the Velocity Obstacle concept. The results obtained show that, when provided with the same amount of information about the future evolution of the environment, ICS-AVOID outperforms the other two schemes. The first reason for this has to do with the extent to which each collision avoidance scheme reasons about the future. The second reason has to do with the ability of each collision avoidance scheme to find a safe control if one exists. ICS-AVOID is the only one which is complete in this respect thanks to the concept of Safe Control Kernel.},

	abstract = {The automatic landing of a quadrotor is often associated with model uncertainties, measurement noises, and ground effect phenomenon. To mitigate these challenges, the accurate estimation of states especially the height above the ground, and its rate of change is vital. Moreover, the error of ground effect model can also be estimated and compensated during landing. In this paper, the recently developed continuous ant colony filter is implemented for integrated estimation of states and parameters. The estimated states are used in height control loop. To investigate the closed loop performance of the filter, two control strategies, a classical proportional-integral-derivative controller and a sliding mode controller are utilized and their performance are compared in the presence of ground effect compensation and without it. Also, the error of ground effect model is estimated and compensated in landing algorithm. Finally, a landing procedure is proposed including a ground effect estimation phase before the touchdown. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the landing performance when the ground effect is properly compensated. Moreover, small estimation errors, obtained from the simulations, prove the good performance of the new filter in states and parameters estimation.},

The proposed algorithm is based on the 3D-Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm. Several improvements have been implemented such as considering dynamic constraints of the UAV model and static obstacles, so it can be used in realistic environments.

An analytical solution for this control problem, based on a three dimensional geometric approach, is derived. It does not require the solution of any programming problem, thus resulting suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, the availability of an analytical solution allows the application of well assessed control analysis and synthesis techniques in order to improve stability and performance robustness. The proposed algorithm performs optimal avoidance maneuvers, both in the horizontal and vertical plane, by minimizing aircraft deviation from its nominal trajectory. Its effectiveness has been proved via numerical simulations, in proper conflict scenarios which take into account aircraft dynamics and on-board sensors limitations},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, there has been much research on various aspects of control of autonomous vehicles. However, it seems that the problem of overtaking a slower moving vehicle has been somewhat neglected. This note deals with the three-phase overtaking maneuver and with designing a smooth and ergonomic optimal lane-change trajectory to be used under normal conditions. It is shown that the absolute shape, size, and time of the first-phase trajectory do not depend on the velocity of the leading, slower moving vehicle. Only the absolute point for initiating the diversion is affected. The relatively simple mathematical model for each lane-change trajectory is based on minimizing the total kinetic energy during the maneuver, superimposed on a "minimum-jerk trajectory." For high enough initial velocities, explicit formulas are obtained for the optimal distance and the optimal time of the maneuver. It is also shown that the total time is bounded from above and below, regardless of the velocity. By using the results of the suggested model, an autonomous vehicle, equipped with appropriate sensors, can estimate the best time and place to begin and end the overtaking and its total time and distance. This may help to make a decision whether to overtake or not.},

The computations use state estimate and covariance from a target tracking filter based on angle-only sensors such as digital video cameras. The majority of existing work is focused on risk estimation at a certain time instant. Here we derive an expression for the integrated risk over the critical time horizon. This is possible using probability for level-crossing, and the expression applies to a three-dimensional piecewise straight flight trajectory. The Monte Carlo technique provides a method to compute the probability, but a huge number of simulations is needed to get sufficient reliability for the small risks that the applications require. Instead we propose a method which through sound geometric and numerical approximations yields a solution suitable for real-time implementations. The algorithm is applied to realistic angle-only tracking data, and shows promising results when compared with the Monte Carlo solution.},

	abstract = {The high density of small aircrafts increasingly threatens flight safety during low-altitude flights. Unlike general air transport aircraft, small aircrafts do not install active detection for collision avoidance. Through available surveillance communication, small aircraft can be monitored and separated on a surveillance dependence basis. A low-altitude collision avoidance system algorithm is introduced to offer the required separation solution to small aircrafts at low altitude. Based on the automatic dependent surveillance concept under the visual flight rule, aircraft traffic alert and collision avoidance system operation can be built on a ground surveillance computer as well as being installed as a airborne electronic flight instrument system (EFIS). Aircraft conflict will be detected and calculated from the surveillance information. Simple traffic resolution rules can be created for collision avoidance after alerts are simultaneously generated on the ground computer and on airborne EFIS. Following the general basic rules, the resolution algorithm could be induced. This article refers to traffic advisory and resolution advisory, and designs a simple avoidance manipulation for small aircrafts. In this development, ultra-light flights are operated to create the actual flight data in a small airspace. Several feasible scenarios are tested in simulations to look into the TCAS performance on ground computer and airborne EFIS. The results offer better flight safety management for low-altitude flights.},

Feasible paths of each aircraft constitute its own sub-population which can evolve distributed and in parallel with Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Fitness is evaluated by cooperation among individuals from different sub-population. Further, a novel real number encoding method with adaptive searching mechanism is introduced to improve the searching efficiency. Compared with GA currently being used for CR path optimization, the results of our method have higher system efficiency.},

	abstract = {The dynamic similarity hypothesis postulates that different mammals move in a dynamically similar fashion whenever they travel at speeds that give them equal values of a dimensionless parameter, the Froude number. Thus, given information about one species, it could be possible to predict for others relationships between size, speed and features of gait such as stride length, duty factor, the phase relationships of the feet and the patterns of force exerted on the ground.
Data for a diverse sample of mammals have been used to test the hypothesis. It is found to be tenable in many cases when comparisons are confined to quadrupedal mammals of the type described by Jenkins (1971) as “cursorial”. Most mammals of mass greater than 5 kg are of this type. Although the hypothesis applies less successfully to comparisons between cursorial and non-cursorial mammals it is shown to be a reasonable approximation even for such comparisons and for comparisons between quadrupedal mammals and bipedal mammals and birds.},

	abstract = {The spontaneous organization of collective activities in animal groups and societies has attracted a considerable amount of attention over the last decade. This kind of coordination often permits group-living species to achieve collective tasks that are far beyond single individuals' capabilities. In particular, a key benefit lies in the integration of partial knowledge of the environment at the collective level. In this contribution, we discuss various self-organization phenomena in animal swarms and human crowds from the point of view of information exchange among individuals. In particular, we provide a general description of collective dynamics across species and introduce a classification of these dynamics not only with respect to the way information is transferred among individuals but also with regard to the knowledge processing at the collective level. Finally, we highlight the fact that the individual’s ability to learn from past experiences can have a feedback effect on the collective dynamics, as experienced with the development of behavioral conventions in pedestrian crowds.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0269888912000239},
	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of generating conflict-free movement schedules for a set of vehicles that are operating simultaneously in a common airspace. In both civilian air traffic management and military air campaign planning contexts, it is crucial that the movements of different vehicles be coordinated so as to avoid collisions and near misses. Our approach starts from a view of airspace management as a 4D resource allocation problem, where the space in which vehicles must maneuver is itself managed as a capacitated resource. We introduce a linear octree representation of airspace capacity to index vector-based vehicle routes and efficiently detect regions of potential conflict. Generalizing the notion of contention-based search heuristics, we next define a scheduling algorithm that proceeds by first solving a relaxed version of the problem to construct a spatial capacity profile (represented as an octree), and then using spatio-temporal regions where demand exceeds capacity to make conflict-avoiding vehicle routing and scheduling decisions. We illustrate the utility of this basic representation and search algorithm in two ways. First, to demonstrate the overall viability of the approach, we present experimental results using data representing a realistically sized air campaign planning domain. Second, we define a more abstract notion of ‘encounter set’, which tolerates some amount of conflict on the assumption that on-board deconfliction processes can take appropriate avoidance maneuvers at execution time, and show that generation of this more abstract form of predictive guidance can be obtained without loss in computational efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a successive gait-transition method with stability secured for a quadruped walking robot. The gait-transitions from a standard gait such as a crawl gait and a rotation gait are investigated to realize the static stable walk. The X-crawl, Y-crawl, O-rotation and their reverse gait are the standard gaits. In the proposed method, the common foot positions, those are the same leg arrangements among standard gaits, are utilized for stable and smooth gait transition. The experimental results show that proposed gait transition is efficient and realized in a short time without that the robot is in the unstable conditions.},

	abstract = {Logistics simulation plays critical roles to design factories and to verify production schedules. It is time-consuming, in general, to simulate large-scale logistic models in details. We have developed a discrete-event simulator (SIMXPERT), which employed a rule-based inference engine. The engine equips algorithms for pattern matching and conflict resolution that are far higher in performance than those used in the conventional inference engines. We have developed a system using the SIMXPERT to simulate behaviors of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) that were constructed in a factory at Kimitsu-Works of Nippon Steel Co. This system was useful to examine the valid number of vehicles and reasonable ways to control them. Operators of the factory validate schedules of mills and vehicles based on future inventory levels of products predicted by the system. It takes one minute to simulate the precise movements of hundreds of products carried by several vehicles. This paper describes the overall system design and presents the simulation result based on real data. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICUAS.2014.6842311},
	abstract = {The increasing demand for the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in various social and economic applications have pressed aviation authorities to draw up rules and regulations that permit the release of such aircraft in non-segregated airspace. However, issues related to the safety of air traffic operations arise when considering the possibility of coexistence of manned and unmanned aircraft simultaneously. Thus, surveillance plays a key role in monitoring and controlling air traffic in new scenarios. The positional information provided by the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), originally designed to improve situational awareness for pilots and support controllers in air traffic management, interacts with the Sense and Avoid Systems (S\&AS) of the UAS in order to avoid exposure to events of loss of separation (AIRPROX) and collisions. This paper presents a qualitative approach to assess safety when using ADS-B systems integrated with UASs in aeronautical operations. In addition, the possibility of using a methodology previously applied on manned systems for assessing safety on UASs is discussed. A new testing platform (PIpE-SEC) is presented as a possible solution for this safety evaluation.},

This paper presents a survey of the collision avoidance approaches those deployed for aircraft, especially for unmanned aerial vehicles. The collision avoidance concept is introduced together with proposing generic functions carried by collision avoidance systems. The design factors of the sense and avoid system, which are used to categorize methods, are explained deeply. Based on the design factors, several typical approaches are categorized.},

	abstract = {Reactive path planning to avoid collisions with moving obstacles enables more robust agent systems. However, many solutions assume that moving objects are passive; that is, they do not consider that the moving objects are themselves re-planning to avoid collisions, and thus may change their trajectory. In this paper we present a model, Anticipatory Stigmergic Collision Avoidance (ASCA) for reciprocal collision avoidance using anticipatory stigmergy. Unlike standard stigmergy, in which agents leave pheromones to indicate a trace of previous actions, anticipatory stigmergy deposits pheromones on intended future paths. By sharing their intended future paths with each other at regular intervals, agents can re-plan to attempt to avoid collisions. We experimentally evaluate ASCA over three scenarios, and compare with a state of art approach, Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO). Our evaluation showed that ASCA is consistently more robust in noisy environments in which transmitted information can be lost or degraded. Further, using ASCA without noise results in fewer collisions than RVO when agents are in formation, but more collisions when formed randomly.},

In our previous work, simulation studies revealed that a quadruped robot produces walk and trot patterns through dynamic interactions among the robot's mechanical system, the oscillator network system, and the environment. These studies also showed that a walk-trot transition is induced by changing the walking speed. In addition, the gait-pattern transition exhibited a hysteresis similar to that observed in the locomotion of humans and animals. The aim of the present study is to verify such dynamic characteristics in the gait generation of quadrupedal locomotion in the real world by developing and evaluating a quadruped robot.},

Agents move on reserved areas which are guaranteed not to intersect, therefore ensuring safety. The basic algorithm is augmented by the introduction of waypoints, which increase performance at the cost of additional wireless traffic. The algorithm is successfully implemented in simulation and on a real system of autonomous robots. The results are presented and discussed.},

Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing identified the potential of UAS-sourced imagery more than thirty years ago. In the last five years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros. In this review article, following a brief historic background and regulatory status analysis, we review the recent unmanned aircraft, sensing, navigation, orientation and general data processing developments for UAS photogrammetry and remote sensing with emphasis on the nano-micro-mini UAS segment.},

Assuming that the locations and the sizes of the trees are determined by an ergodic point process, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. In other words, if the bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, with probability one, i.e., the bird will eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm governing its motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for the special case of a Poisson forest considering a simple model for the bird's dynamics. Moreover, results from an extensive Monte-Carlo simulation study are presented. This paper also establishes novel connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory and the theory of percolation, which may be of independent interest.},

While military applications still dominate UAS use, civilian UAS usage is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years. However with this growth, there are significant air safety concerns. SAASs have been proposed as potential solutions for air traffic collisions and obstacle avoidance, but the technical implementations have been largely unsatisfactory. The development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) surveillance tracking technology known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) has been proposed as one of the potential solutions. This technology, mandated to be in all aircraft by 2020, is designed to improve situational awareness for pilots and improve air traffic management but may also be utilized by UASs. However there remains implementation issues and regulatory issues, especially for small UASs (SUASs) that are expected to be used significantly by civilian operators. This paper examines the use of ADS-B in future SAASs and their implementations in SUAS for domestic use.},

	abstract = {Flocking motions have been the subject of hundreds of studies over the past six decades. The vast majority of models have nearly identical aims: bottom-up demonstration of basic emergent flocking motions. Despite a significant fraction of the literature providing algorithmic descriptions of models, incompleteness and imprecision are also readily identifiable in flocking algorithms, algorithmic input, and validation of the models. To address this issue, this meta-study introduces a data-flow template, which unifies many of the existing approaches. Additionally, there are small differences and ambiguities in the flocking scenarios being studied by different researchers; unfortunately, these differences are of considerable significance. For example, much subtlety is needed to specify sensory requirements exactly and minor modifications may critically alter a flock’s exhibited motions. We introduce two taxonomies that minimize both incompleteness and imprecision, and enable us to highlight those publications that study flocking motions under comparable assumptions. Furthermore, we aggregate and translate the publications into a consolidated notation. The common notation along with the data-flow template and the two taxonomies constitute a collection of tools, that together, facilitates complete and precise flocking motion models, and enables much of the work to be unified. To conclude, we make recommendations for more diverse research directions and propose criteria for rigorous problem definitions and descriptions of future flocking motion models.},

One is the measurement of physical quantities that affect riding comfort and the other is the measurement of the corresponding feeling of human beings. Although various evaluation scales have been proposed, an evaluation criterion universally applicable has not been established yet. To encourage discussions on the evaluation of riding comfort of railway vehicles, this paper reviews relevant researches carried out in Japan. Topics covered include features of riding comfort of railway vehicles, vibrational characteristics that affect riding comfort, momentary and long-term vibration, riding comfort criteria in Japan, response indices to riding comfort and motion sickness experienced on railway vehicles.},

The reason is that today’s Internet is the main instance of a large-scale and highly complex system. Simulation of Internet-scale network systems has to be supported by any simulation tool. Despite this fact, many network simulators lacks support for building large models. In this work, in order to propose a new approach for scalability issue in network simulation tools, a network simulator is developed based on behavior of honeybees and high performance DEVS, modular and hierarchical system theoretic approach. A biologically-inspired discrete event modeling approach is described for studying networks’ scalability and performance traits. Since natural systems can offer important concepts for modeling network systems, key adaptive and emergent attributes of honeybees and their societal properties are incorporated into a set of simulation models that are developed using the discrete event system specification approach. Large-scale network models are simulated and evaluated to show the benefits of nature-inspired network models.},

This paper presents the results of experiments conducted to demonstrate a set of algorithms on a surveillance system employing a swarm of quadrotor UAVs to track detected targets. It was initially assumed that the UAV paths are generated at constant altitude to replace the complicated quadrotor dynamics by ones of a point mass entity. The system is then extended to the third dimension to allow for a more complex guidance and navigation scheme.

The artificial potential field method is combined with genetic algorithms, to derive optimal potential field functions. The proposed EAPF approach is capable of navigating robot(s) situated among moving obstacles. Potential field functions for obstacles and goal points are also defined. The potential field functions for obstacles contain tunable parameters. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is utilized to identify the optimal potential field functions. Fitness functions such as goal-factor, obstacle-factor, smoothness-factor and minimum-pathlength-factor are developed for the MOEA selection criteria. An algorithm named escape-force is introduced to avoid the local minima associated with EAPF. Moving obstacles and moving goal positions were considered to test the robust performance of the proposed methodology. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology is efficient and robust for robot path planning with non-stationary goals and obstacles},

This improves the robot stability and smoothness while locomoting.

We apply nonlinear oscillators to model Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). These generate the rhythmic locomotor movements for a quadruped robot. The generated trajectories are modulated by a tonic signal, that encodes the required activity and/or modulation. This drive signal strength is mapped onto sets of CPG parameters. By increasing the drive signal, locomotion can be elicited and velocity increased while switching to the appropriate gaits. This drive signal can be specified according to sensory information or set a priori.

The system is implemented in a simulated and real AIBO robot. Results demonstrate the adequacy of the architecture to generate and modulate the required coordinated trajectories according to a velocity increase; and to smoothly and easily switch among the different motor behaviors.},

The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.},

	abstract = {Spatial multiagency has been receiving growing attention from researchers exploring many of the aspects and modalities of this phenomenon. The aim is to develop the theoretical background needed for a multitude of applications involving the sharing of resources by more than one agent. A traffic management system is one of these applications. Here, a large group of mobile robots that are operating in communication-limited, and sensory-limited modes are required to cope with each others presence as well as the contents of their environment while preserving their ability to reach their preset independent goals. This paper explores the construction of a decentralized traffic controller for a large group of agents sharing a workspace with stationary forbidden regions. The suggested multiagent motion controller is complete provided that a lenient condition on the geometry of the workspace is upheld. It has a low computational effort that linearly increases with the number of agents. The controller is also self-organizing; therefore, it is able to deal, on its own, with incomplete information and unexpected situations. In addition to the above, the controller has an open structure to enable any agent to join or leave the group without the remaining agents having to adjust the manner in which they function. To meet these requirements, a definition of decentralization is suggested. This definition equates decentralization to self-organization in a group of agents operating in an artificial-life mode. The definition is used to provide guidelines for the construction of the multiagent controller. The controller is realized using the potential field approach. Theoretical developments, as well as simulation results, are provided},

This model increments error while: (1) counting collisions among cruising pairs of aircraft following the four rules being tested on random headings between randomly placed airports, and (2) calculating mean closing velocities for each rule. The calculations verify that: (1) federal rules increase collision course probabilities by about four times more than for a chaotic system of aircraft cruising at randomly selected altitudes, (2) risk is directly proportional to the level of compliance, and (3) mean closing velocities resulting from the current rule are slightly less than for random altitudes, while being almost twice as high as for the proposed rules. High closing velocities are shown to increase the collision probability.},

Hence, we need a model for collision risk between controlled aircraft in an arbitrary route network, the numerical evaluation of which compares with the well known Reich model for uncontrolled aircraft. We first consider the well-known theory on the (first) hitting of an absorbing boundary by a Markov process. Since the characterization of (first) hitting reads in terms of a partial differential equation with boundary conditions, its numerical evaluation is too complex for a situation of many aircraft in a network. In view of this finding, we next consider the in-crossing of a transient boundary, to develop an extended version of the Reich model which is general enough to model air traffic in arbitrary route networks},

	doi = {10.1109/DASC.2012.6382339},
	abstract = {An open question in algorithms for aircraft is what can be validated by simulation where the simulation shows that the probability of undesirable events is below some given level at some confidence level. The problem is including enough realism to be convincing while retaining enough efficiency to run the large number of trials needed for high confidence. The paper first proposes a goal based on the number of flights per year in several regions. The paper examines the probabilistic interpretation of this goal and computes the number of trials needed to establish it at an equivalent confidence level. Since any simulation is likely to consider the algorithms for only one type of event and there are several types of events, the paper examines under what conditions this separate consideration is valid. This paper is an initial effort, and as such, it considers separation maneuvers, which are elementary but include numerous aspects of aircraft behavior. The scenario includes decisions under uncertainty since the position of each aircraft is only known to the other by broadcasting where GPS believes each aircraft to be (ADS-B). Each aircraft operates under feedback control with perturbations. It is shown that a scenario three or four orders of magnitude more complex is feasible. The question of what can be validated by simulation remains open, but there is reason to be optimistic},

The method is based on the notion of vector fields, which are used to generate desired course inputs to inner-loop attitude control laws. Vector-field path-following control laws are developed for straight-line paths and circular arcs and orbits. Lyapunov stability arguments are used to demonstrate asymptotic decay of path-following errors in the presence of constant wind disturbances. Experimental flight tests have demonstrated mean path-following errors on less than one wingspan for straight-line and orbit paths and less than three wingspans for paths with frequent changes in direction.},

Such a state is an Inevitable Collision State (ICS). The ICS concept is particularly useful for navigation in dynamic environments because it takes into account the future behaviour of the moving objects. Accordingly it requires a model of the future evolution of the environment. In the real-world, the future trajectories of the obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation of the ICS concept which incorporates uncertainty in the model of the future trajectories of the obstacles. It also presents two novel probabilistic ICS-checking algorithms that are compared with their deterministic counterpart.},

In Part I, we presented the mathematical foundation of our framework, where we model motion discomfort as a weighted cost functional and define comfortable motion planning as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem of computing trajectories that minimize this discomfort given the appropriate boundary conditions and constraints. In this paper, we discretize the infinite-dimensional optimization problem using conforming finite elements. We describe shape functions to handle different kinds of boundary conditions and the choice of unknowns to obtain a sparse Hessian matrix. We also describe in detail how any trajectory computation problem can have infinitely many locally optimal solutions and our method of handling them. Additionally, since we have a nonlinear and constrained problem, computation of high quality initial guesses is crucial for efficient solution. We show how to compute them.},

This paper discusses en route aircraft which are assumed to be linked by real time data bases like ADS-B. With this data base, all UAVs share the information each other. Calculating PCA (point of closest approach), we can evaluate the worst conflict condition between two UAVs. This paper proposes one resolution maneuvering logic, which can be called dasiavector sharing resolutionpsila. In case of conflict, using miss distance vector in PCA, we can decide the directions for two UAVs to share the conflict region. With these directions, UAVs are going to maneuver cooperatively. First of all, this paper describes some dasia2Dpsila conflict scenarios and then extends to dasia3Dpsila conflict scenarios.},

The problem of air traffic control (ATC) within a group of potentially conflicting vehicles is represented as an autonomous, self-organizing process.

Through this process, real-time knowledge-based predictions of near term flight paths are made to prevent and resolve conflicts in a group of vehicles under normal and demanding conditions.

	abstract = {Recent advances in navigation and data communication technologies make   it feasible for individual aircraft to plan and fly their trajectories   in the presence of other aircraft in the airspace. This way, each   aircraft can take advantage of the atmospheric and traffic conditions to   optimally plan its path. This capability is termed the free-Right   concept. Whereas the free-flight concept provides new degrees of freedom   to the aircraft operators, it also brings in complexities not present in   the current air traffic control system. In this concept, each aircraft   has the responsibility for navigating around other aircraft in the   airspace. Although this is not a difficult task under low-speed,   low-traffic-density conditions, the complexities of dealing with   potential conflicts with multiple aircraft in other fight conditions can   significantly increase the pilot's work load. The development of   conflict resolution algorithms is presented based on trajectory   optimization methods that will the enable the practical implementation   of the free-flight concept. These algorithms use nonlinear point-mass   aircraft models and include realistic operational constraints on   individual aircraft. Several conflict resolution scenarios are   illustrated. The present analytical framework can also incorporate   information about ambient atmospheric conditions. These conflict   resolution algorithms are suitable for implementation onboard aircraft.},

	volume = {3088},
	isbn = {0-8194-2503-6},
	abstract = {Today's aircraft equipment comprise several independent warning and hazard avoidance systems like GPWS, TCAS or weather radar. It is the pilot's task to monitor all these systems and take the appropriate action in case of an emerging hazardous situation.   The developed method for detecting and avoiding flight hazards combines all potential external threats for an aircraft into a single system. It is based on an aircraft surrounding airspace model consisting of discrete volume elements. For each element of the volume the threat probability is derived or computed from sensor output, databases, or information provided via datalink. The position of the own aircraft is predicted by utilising a probability distribution. This approach ensures that all potential positions of the aircraft within the near future are considered while weighting the most likely flight path. A conflict detection algorithm initiates an alarm in case the threat probability exceeds a threshold. An escape manoeuvre is generated taking into account all potential hazards in the vicinity, not only the one which caused the alarm, The pilot gets a visual information about the type, the location, and severeness of the threat,   The algorithm was implemented and tested in a flight simulator environment. The current version comprises traffic, terrain and obstacle hazards avoidance functions. Its general formulation allows an easy integration of e.g. weather information or airspace restrictions.},

If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission's range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is Theta;(W radic;An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only Theta;(W/ radic;n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance},

In multi-robot systems, robots operating in parallel can potentially learn at a much faster rate by sharing information amongst themselves. In this work, we use an adapted version of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in order to accomplish distributed online robotic learning in groups of robots with access to only local information. The effectiveness of the learning technique on a benchmark task (generating high-performance obstacle avoidance behavior) is evaluated for robot groups of various sizes, with the maximum group size allowing each robot to individually contain and manage a single PSO particle. To increase the realism of the technique, different PSO neighborhoods based on limitations of real robotic communication are tested and compared in this scenario. We explore the effect of varying communication power for one of these communication-based PSO neighborhoods. To validate the effectiveness of these learning techniques, fully distributed online learning experiments are run using a group of 10 real robots, generating results which support the findings from our simulations.},

	abstract = {The Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formal modeling and simulation (M\&S) framework (which supports hierarchical and modular model composition) has been widely used to understand, analyze and develop a variety of systems. Numerous DEVS simulators have been developed; nevertheless, evaluating the performance of such simulators is a complex process and it has been usually done using ad hoc methods. DEVStone, instead, is a synthetic benchmark that can be used to automate the evaluation of the performance of DEVS-based simulators. DEVStone generates a suite of models with varied structure and behavior automatically. To do so, it uses a standardized mechanism that can be the basis for comparisons between simulation software tools. As a proof of the concept, we present various tests in which DEVStone was used to study the efficiency of five different simulation engines. In this case, we compared various versions of the CD++ simulator, and then compared its performance with the ‘A Discrete Event System Simulator’ (ADEVS) M\&S tool. This is the first effort in which these simulation tools have been thoroughly compared with a very demanding set of experiments. The use of DEVStone allowed a standardized and exhaustive method to compare different features of the simulation software. We show how the basic ideas used for DEVStone facilitates performance analysis for upgrades and updates of a given simulation engine, while also providing a common metric to compare different M\&S environments.},

	abstract = {We present the first unified modeling framework for the computation of the throughput capacity of random wireless ad hoc networks in which information is disseminated by means of unicast routing, multicast routing, broadcasting, or different forms of anycasting. We introduce (n,m, k)-casting as a generalization of all forms of one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many information dissemination in wireless networks. In this context, n, m, and k denote the total number of nodes in the network, the number of destinations for each communication group, and the actual number of communication-group members that receive information (i.e., k lesm), respectively. We compute upper and lower bounds for the (n, m, k)- cast throughput capacity in random wireless networks. When m = k = ominus(1), the resulting capacity equals the well-known capacity result for multi-pair unicasting by Gupta and Kumar. We demonstrate that ominus(1/radic(mnlogn)) bits per second constitutes a tight bound for the capacity of multicasting (i.e., m = k lt; n) when m les ominus (n/(log n)). We show that the multicast capacity of a wireless network equals its capacity for multi-pair unicasting when the number of destinations per multicast source is not a function of n. We also show that the multicast capacity of a random wireless ad hoc network is ominus (1/n), which is the broadcast capacity of the network, when m ges ominus(n/ log n). Furthermore, we show that ominus (radicm/(kradic(n log n))),ominus(1/(k log n)) and ominus(1/n) bits per second constitutes a tight bound for the throughput capacity of multicasting (i.e., k lt; m lt; n) when ominus(1) les m les ominus (n/ log n), k les ominus(n / log n) les m les n and ominus (n/ log n) les k les m les n respectively.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method to improve the efficiency of a swarm of robots searching in an unknown environment. The approach focuses on the process of feeding and individual coordination characteristics inspired by the foraging behavior in nature. A predatory strategy was used for searching; hence, this hybrid approach integrated a random search technique with a dynamic particle swarm optimization (DPSO) search algorithm. If a search robot could not find any target information, it used a random search algorithm for a global search. If the robot found any target information in a region, the DPSO search algorithm was used for a local search. This particle swarm optimization search algorithm is dynamic as all the parameters in the algorithm are refreshed synchronously through a communication mechanism until the robots find the target position, after which, the robots fall back to a random searching mode. Thus, in this searching strategy, the robots alternated between two searching algorithms until the whole area was covered. During the searching process, the robots used a local communication mechanism to share map information and DPSO parameters to reduce the communication burden and overcome hardware limitations. If the search area is very large, search efficiency may be greatly reduced if only one robot searches an entire region given the limited resources available and time constraints. In this research we divided the entire search area into several subregions, selected a target utility function to determine which subregion should be initially searched and thereby reduced the residence time of the target to improve search efficiency.},

For example, it has been shown that available cabin pressure during normal flight altitude can significantly inhibit gastric emptying and induce dyspepsia-like symptoms when associated with a fibre-rich meal. Other aspects of the cabin environment such as space and variability of seating, air quality, and noise, also have been shown to modulate (reduce or increase) discomfort and nausea during flights. Individual passenger characteristics and health status also have been demonstrated to increase vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and discomfort.},

Based on numerical simulations, we showed that the robot produces various gait patterns through dynamical interactions among the robot mechanical system, oscillator control system, and environment and establishes gait transition induced by the change of the roll joint stiffness. In addition, we demonstrated that a hysteresis with respect to gait pattern occurs during the gait transition similarly to humans and animals, and we examined the mechanisms of the hysteresis from a dynamic viewpoint.},

	abstract = {The study of locomotor patterns has been a major research goal in the last decades. Understanding how intralimb and interlimb coordination works out so well in animals’ locomotion is a hard and challenging task. Many models have been proposed to model animal’s rhythms. These models have also been applied to the control of rhythmic movements of adaptive legged robots, namely biped, quadruped and other designs.

In this paper we study gait transition in a central pattern generator (CPG) model for bipeds, the 4-cells model. This model is proposed by Golubitsky, Stewart, Buono and Collins and is studied further by Pinto and Golubitsky. We briefly resume the work done by Pinto and Golubitsky. We compute numerically gait transition in the 4-cells CPG model for bipeds. We use Morris–Lecar equations and Wilson–Cowan equations as the internal dynamics for each cell. We also consider two types of coupling between the cells: diffusive and synaptic. We obtain secondary gaits by bifurcation of primary gaits, by varying the coupling strengths. Nevertheless, some bifurcating branches could not be obtained, emphasizing the fact that despite analytically those bifurcations exist, finding them is a hard task and requires variation of other parameters of the equations. We note that the type of coupling did not influence the results.},

	abstract = {Prey living in groups often partly rely on companions to detect predators. Accordingly, individuals having vigilant neighbors could decrease their own vigilance, engendering a certain level of vigilance coordination in the group. However, when a predator attacks, individuals that spot it react quicker than individuals that follow them and have less chance of being targeted. Individuals with vigilant neighbors may then be particularly exposed, since they risk lagging behind their companions in an attack. Here, we incorporate this effect in a spatially explicit model of vigilance. A first version of the model derives the evolutionarily stable proportion of time allocated to vigilance for each position in the group. A second version considers the real alternation of feeding and vigilance and allows individuals to respond immediately when their neighbors raise their head or resume feeding. The model confirms then that the collective detection effect tends to coordinate vigilance. However, when predators display marked preferences for stragglers, adaptive response by prey generates waves of collective vigilance that may spread and circulate over the group. The overall level of vigilance in the group strongly oscillates, sometimes far away from the evolutionarily stable values, and the stabilizing effect of vigilance coordination is thwarted. These results illustrate real patterns of vigilance, in particular, the fact that group members often synchronize their vigilance.},

	abstract = {We present a path planning algorithm based on 3D Dubins Curves [1] for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to avoid both static and moving obstacles. A variation of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) [2] is used as the planner. In tree expansion, branches of the tree are generated by propagating along 3D Dubins Curves. The node sequence of shortest length together with Dubins curves connecting them is selected as the path. When the UAV executes the path, the path is checked for collision with updated obstacles' states. A new path is generated if the previous one is predicted to collide with obstacles. Such checking and replanning loop repeats until the UAV reaches the goal. The algorithm was validated through flight experiments using a small quadrotor UAV. In total, 6 flights to avoid static obstacles, 24 flights to avoid virtual moving obstacles and 20 flights to avoid real moving obstacles were performed. The efficacy of the algorithm was tested in office conditions and a parking structure. In all the situations our algorithm was able to reliably plan paths in real time and command the UAV to avoid obstacles.},

	abstract = {Metros are the principal means of public transportation in many of the world’s cities, and continue to grow in the face of rising demand. Expanding metro infrastructure is costly, however, and at a certain point becomes unsustainable. When this occurs the only feasible solution is to improve the train’s management system by using either offline approaches, such as pre-programming schedules which use historic information, or online approaches which employ system status information obtained during operation. A new planning or control system, be it on or off line, requires prior testing that usually involves conducting simulations. This paper presents the design and implementation of an event-driven dynamic simulator for multi-line metro systems, and its practical application for studying different operating strategies. The simulator is based on object-oriented programming and is capable of interacting with Matlab programs written by the user to design and evaluate real-time control strategies. This article describes the model upon which the simulator is based, presents the user interface, and demonstrates how to use the simulator for operating strategies evaluation in the Santiago de Chile multi-line metropolitan rail network.},

	abstract = {We present an approach for collision avoidance for mobile robots that takes into account acceleration constraints. We discuss both the case of navigating a single robot among moving obstacles, and the case of multiple robots reciprocally avoiding collisions with each other while navigating a common workspace. Inspired by the concept of velocity obstacles [3], we introduce the acceleration-velocity obstacle (AVO) to let a robot avoid collisions with moving obstacles while obeying acceleration constraints. AVO characterizes the set of new velocities the robot can safely reach and adopt using proportional control of the acceleration. We extend this concept to reciprocal collision avoidance for multi-robot settings, by letting each robot take half of the responsibility of avoiding pairwise collisions. Our formulation guarantees collision-free navigation even as the robots act independently and simultaneously, without coordination. Our approach is designed for holonomic robots, but can also be applied to kinematically constrained non-holonomic robots such as cars. We have implemented our approach, and we show simulation results in challenging environments with large numbers of robots and obstacles.},

One type of DST, conflict detection and resolution (CD R) tools, will play an important role in air traffic management both on the ground and in the air. A number of aircraft CD R algorithms have been developed in recent years; however, there is no detailed competitive analysis that clearly demonstrates their effectiveness and efficiency. Kuchar and Yang (1997) surveyed multiple algorithms and documented their strengths, but the impact on the users of these algorithms has not yet been tested in simulated conditions with realistic traffic situations. Most of the studies examining individual algorithm effectiveness use either the fast-time or Monte Carlo process. Therefore, there is a need to examine and compare the effectiveness of these algorithms from a human-centered perspective.},

	abstract = {We consider optimal resolution of air traffic (AT) conflicts. Aircraft are assumed to cruise within a given altitude layer and are modeled as a kinematic system with constant velocity and curvature bounds. Aircraft cannot get closer to each other than a predefined safety distance. For such a system of multiple aircraft, we consider the problem of planning optimal paths among given waypoints. Necessary conditions for optimality of solutions are derived and used to devise a parametrization of possible trajectories that turns into efficient numerical solutions to the problem. Simulation results for a realistic aircraft conflict scenario are provided. A decentralized implementation of the optimal conflict resolution scheme is introduced that may allow free-flight coordination in a cooperative airspace management scheme. Impact of decentralization on performance and safety is finally discussed with the help of extensive simulations},

Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) approaches produce excessive transmission collisions at high vehicle densities and are vulnerable to a variety of denial of service (DoS) attacks. Explicit time slot allocation approaches tend to be limited by the need for a fixed infrastructure, a high number of control messages, or poor bandwidth utilization, particularly in low-density traffic. This paper presents a novel adaptation of the explicit timeslot allocation protocols for IVC networks. The protocol requires no control messages, provides protection against a range of DoS attacks, significantly improves bandwidth utilization, and automatically adjusts the timeslot allocation in response to changes in vehicle densities.},

Parameters of the study include queueing network topology and routing probabilities, number of processors, and assignment of network nodes to processors.

	abstract = {Howarth HVC, Griffin MJ. Effect of roll oscillation frequency on motion sickness. Aviat Space Environ Med 2003; 74:326-31. Background: In many environments associated with motion sickness there are low frequency motions in several axes, including roll. Roll motion has often been assumed to be a cause of motion sickness, either alone or in combination with motions in other axes. However, there have been no systematic studies of the effects of roll frequency on sickness. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that sickness caused by roll oscillation would depend on the frequency of roll. Method: There were 100 male subjects (aged 18 to 26 yr) who participated in a laboratory study. Prior to experiencing motion, all subjects completed a motion sickness history questionnaire giving information on travel and motion sickness experience. The seated subjects were exposed within a closed cabin to 30 min of sinusoidal roll motion at one of five frequencies: 0.025 Hz, 0.05 Hz, 0.10 Hz, 0.20 Hz, or 0.40 Hz. At each frequency, the cabin oscillated through ±8° about a center of rotation located on the seat surface. Ratings of motion sickness were obtained at 1-min intervals. Results: Subject illness ratings were positively correlated with their previous motion sickness, although at each frequency the amount of sickness was small. Overall, there was no significant difference in the sickness ratings produced by the five motions. Conclusions: The frequency dependence of motion sickness produced by roll oscillation differs from that associated with vertical and horizontal oscillation. Motion sickness associated with pure roll oscillation of a seat will usually be less than the sickness associated with pure translational oscillation of the seat or the sickness associated with combined translation and rotation.},

In this work we demonstrate the applicability of a concurrent evolutionary design of the optimal sensory and controller parts of a system for the example of an adaptive wing design. The focus of the work is twofold. First on the realization of developmental stages of the sensory and controlling systems design, defined as a growth process, and second on the comparison of the differences in structures of the systems developed through the presented evolutionary growth method and of evolved systems, having fixed set of sensory elements. We ascertained that the success of the realized growth process depends among others on the relation between the triggering methods and timing of the system enlargement and on parameter settings of the optimization strategy after a growth phase.},

	abstract = {Airborne separation assurance is a key requirement for Free Flight operations. A variety of conflict detection (CD) and resolution algorithms have been developed for this task. A lack of rigorous evaluation and the existence of an infinite number of possible conflict geometries in Free Flight makes the choice of which algorithm to be placed in the cockpit a challenging task for the designers of future air traffic management (ATM) systems. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach for CD in Free Flight. The ensemble consists of several CD algorithms, a rule set for each algorithm describing its learned behavior from its past performance and a switch mechanism to choose an appropriate CD algorithm given probe characteristics. A novel mechanism to evolve complex conflict scenarios, using genetic algorithms (GA), is developed and integrated in a fast time air traffic simulator to generate the performance data of CD algorithms. Data mining techniques are then employed to identify implicit patterns in the probe characteristics where the CD algorithms missed or falsely identified a conflict. These patterns are formulated as rule sets for each CD algorithm and are then used by a switch in the ensemble to route a probe for conflict prediction. Given probe characteristics, the CD algorithm, which is less likely to miss or falsely identify a conflict, is selected to evaluate the probe for potential conflict. The performance of the ensemble and of individual algorithms is evaluated by comparing the Pareto efficient set of solutions generated by them. The ensemble approach demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of missed detects and false alarms as compared to individual algorithms. The proposed methodology is capable of accommodating existing as well as new CD models and can be extended to other ATM concepts as well.},

Since time discretization is known to affect the results when numerically solving differential equations, it stands to reason that it might likewise affect the results of such simulations. This paper demonstrates that is indeed the case. Using simple queueing models, we demonstrate that the size of the time step can have a substantial impact on estimated measures of performance. While large time steps can execute faster than a corresponding discrete event model, there can be substantial errors in the estimates. Conversely, with small time steps the results match both the discrete event measures as well as the analytic values, but can take substantially longer to execute.},

	abstract = {In this paper, dynamic collision-free trajectory generation in a nonstationary environment is studied using biologically inspired neural network approaches. The proposed neural network is topologically organized, where the dynamics of each neuron is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. The state space of the neural network can be either the Cartesian workspace or the joint space of multi-joint robot manipulators. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. The real-time optimal trajectory is generated through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over the free space nor the collision paths, without explicitly optimizing any global cost functions, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, and without any learning procedures. Therefore the model algorithm is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network system is guaranteed by the existence of a Lyapunov function candidate. In addition, this model is not very sensitive to the model parameters. Several model variations are presented and the differences are discussed. As examples, the proposed models are applied to generate collision-free trajectories for a mobile robot to solve a maze-type of problem, to avoid concave U-shaped obstacles, to track a moving target and at the same to avoid varying obstacles, and to generate a trajectory for a two-link planar robot with two targets. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies},

In that, our approach is clearly a discrete event approach where the choice of the time interval between two steps of calculation is based on the behavior changes of the process and no longer constant and/or a priori given, the underlying objective being to strictly satisfy to a given accuracy with a low computational cost. More precisely, we present a generalized discrete event model of an integrator using polynomial descriptions of input–output trajectories. We shall show its great capability of easily handling the delicate problem of input discontinuities, and a detailed comparison with classical discrete time simulation methods, will demonstrate its relevant properties. Several examples, including a complete hybrid system, will illustrate our results.},

The learning and generalization capability of the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network in learning gait transitions is then studied. The two gait transition models are the transition between two general periodic gaits and the transition between a periodic gait and a continuous follow-the-leader (FTL) gait, while maintaining FTL mode during the transition. These models are nonlinear and require either heuristic rules or simultaneous solution of several nonlinear equations. Many transition gaits are then generated by these kinematic gait transition models under various gait conditions and evaluated in terms of stability and smoothness of leg movements. The CMAC neural network is then applied to learn the good transition gaits in four transition conditions: (1) from wave gait to wave gait; (2) from wave gait to FTL gait; (3) from walk to trot; and (4) from trot to transverse gallop. The learning and generalization capability of the trained CMAC neural network is evaluated and found to be satisfactory. This study has demonstrated the potential of applying neural networks to learn walking machine gaits and gait transitions.},

In order to improve the robot stability and response while locomoting, we adjust both the duty factor and the interlimb phase relationships, according to the velocities.   We extend previous work, by applying nonlinear oscillators to generate the rhythmic locomotor movements for a quadruped robot, similarly to the biological counterparts. The generated trajectories are modulated by a drive signal, that modifies the oscillator frequency, amplitude and the coupling parameters among the oscillators, proportionally to the drive signal strength. By increasing the drive signal, locomotion can be elicited and velocity increased while switching to the appropriate gaits. This drive signal can be specified according to sensory information or set a priori.   The implementation of the central pattern generator network and the activity modulation layer is shown in simulation and in an AIBO robot.},

In the densely-populated urban areas, pedestrian flows often cross each other and congestion is caused. The congestion makes us feel uncomfortable and sometimes leads to pedestrian accidents. To reduce the congestion or the risk of accidents, it is required to control swarm behavior of pedestrian flows. This paper proposes modeling and controlling method of the crossing pedestrian flows. In the social/urban engineering, it is well known that the swarm behavior with a diagonal stripe pattern emerges in the crossing area of the flows. This is a self-organized phenomenon caused by the local collision avoidance effect of the pedestrians. To control macroscopic behavior of the flows, we utilize this self-organized phenomenon. Firstly, we propose the continuum model of the crossing pedestrian flows. In the continuum model, the dynamic change of the congestion in the diagonal stripe pattern is simulated as the density. Secondly, novel control method to improve average flow velocity is proposed based on the model. The proposed method utilizes dynamic interaction between the diagonal stripe pattern and guides, who are moving in the flows. The authors derive the control algorithm through an analysis on the temporal and spatial frequency of the crossing flows. The validity is verified with simulations using the continuum model. Moreover, we apply the proposed method to the particle model, assuming the actual pedestrians.},

This work proposes the concept of “comfortable map” and presents a navigation approach for autonomous passenger vehicles which in top of being safe and reliable is comfortable. In our approach we first extract information from users preference related to comfort while sitting on a robotic wheelchair under different conditions in an indoor corridor environment. Human-comfort factors are integrated to a geometric map generated by SLAM framework. Then a global planner computes a safe and comfortable path which is followed by the robotic wheelchair. Finally, an evaluation with 29 participants using a fully autonomous robotic wheelchair, showed that more than 90\% of them found the proposed approach more comfortable than a shortest-path state of the art approach.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on an optimal three-dimensional analytical solution for aircraft non-cooperative collision avoidance. Based on a geometric approach, an analytical solution to a proper kinematic optimization problem is here derived, which implies the simultaneous change of all control variables (speed module, track and slope angles), thus this approach resulting very suitable for real-time applications. In a pair-wise non-cooperative collision avoidance, the speed vector of the aircraft implementing the proposed control strategy is continuously changed with the aim of skimming the safety bubble surrounding the other aircraft (considered as an intruder). Under certain hypotheses, the proposed solution can be proved to be optimal with respect to the minimization of aircraft deviation from its nominal trajectory. Proper performance indexes have been defined and challenging conflict scenarios, where the other aircraft be haves even a pursuer, have been analyzed.},

Aircraft can not get closer to each other than a given safety distance in order to avoid possible conflicts between different airplanes. For such system of multiple aircraft, we consider the path planning problem among given waypoints avoiding all possible conflicts. In particular we are interested in optimal paths, i.e., we want to minimize the total flight time. We propose two different formulations of the multiaircraft conflict avoidance problem as a mixed-integer linear program: in the first case only velocity changes are admissible maneuvers, in the second one only heading angle changes are allowed. Due to the linear formulation of the two problems, solutions may be obtained quickly with standard optimization software, allowing our approach to be implemented in real time},

	title = {Unmanned aerial vehicle optimal cooperative obstacle avoidance in a stochastic dynamic environment},
	volume = {34},
	abstract = {Effective target-tracking and obstacle avoidance strategies are essential to the success of unmanned aerial vehicle missions. This paper presents an extended Kalman-filter-based algorithm that predicts the optimal threedimensional trajectory and position prediction error of a dynamic object (obstacle or target) detected by an unmanned aerial vehicle. This trajectory prediction scheme is thereafter tested in a three-dimensional path planner for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, which relies on decentralized model-based predictive control to calculate the optimal unmanned aerial vehicle setpoints that will lead each unmanned aerial vehicle to the interception of a single dynamic ellipsoidal target while avoiding dynamic ellipsoidal obstacles detected en route. A novel model-based predictive control collision avoidance algorithm is also presented in this paper. The method first computes the unmanned aerial vehicle collision probability with an obstacle by convolving the statistical distribution of the obstacle center of mass position with the obstacle shape. The method then seeks to minimize the unmanned aerial vehicle collision probability with all known obstacles on a future horizon, all while ensuring that the collision probability with any given obstacle at each prediction step does not surpass a preset threshold. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Copyright © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

The first is a kinematic planner based on potential fields for which we prove kinematic safety for two- and three-aircraft maneuvers. The second is a real-time hybrid systems implementation of multiple aircraft conflict resolution.

We present two principles, coined selection and beacon control, that differ with respect to their temporal and spatial persistence. The former requires active selection of groups of robots while the latter exerts a passive influence on nearby robots. Both principles are implemented in a testbed in which operators exert influence on a robot swarm by switching between a set of behaviors ranging from trivial behaviors up to distributed autonomous algorithms. Performance is tested in a series of complex foraging tasks in environments with different obstacles ranging from open to cluttered and structured. The robotic swarm has only local communication and sensing capabilities with the number of robots ranging from 50 to 200. Experiments with human operators utilizing either selection or beacon control are compared with each other and to a simple autonomous swarm with regard to performance, adaptation to complex environments, and scalability to larger swarms. Our results show superior performance of autonomous swarms in open environments, of selection control in complex environments, and indicate a potential for scaling beacon control to larger swarms.},

Gaussian statistics with equal or distinct rms deviations for the   two aircraft are used to calculate the probability of coincidence as a   function of time in the first instance, with a correction factors for 1)   the more accurate generalized error distribution; 2) asymmetry in   vertical position errors. The time and distance of closest approach are   used to calculate the position for maximum probability of coincidence.   The cumulative probability of coincidence over all time is calculated,   and expressed as a probability of coincidence per unit distance and per   unit time: the latter is compared with the International Civil Aviation   Organization target level of safety. Examples are given of the effect on   coincidence probabilities of the seven parameters of the problem:   velocities and glide slopes of each aircraft, crossing angle in   horizontal projection, vertical separation; and rms position error.},

The study utilises data from the master file of the 2006 Canadian Census, allowing migrants to be disaggregated by duration of residence. Multiple regressions indicate that living in the most accessible rural areas and being a recent migrant are significantly associated with longer commutes. Furthermore, findings demonstrate that the commute distance of very recent migrants (those who migrated in the year immediately prior to the census) have the longest commute distances. As residential duration increases, commute distance decreases.},

	abstract = {The position of animals within fish shoals, bird flocks, and insect swarms is related to individual differences in hunger, body size, and defenses. These differences relate to the way that animals balance multiple selection pressures including food-distribution and predator-attack patterns. However, the role of drafting/slipstreaming (taking advantage of the vortices of those in front of you) and sex on the position of individuals within a polarized group has not been well studied. For example, although hungry fish have been found to prefer positions toward the front of a shoal on average, the mitigating factors of sex, recent predator exposure, and drafting have not been factored into this response. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with individually marked whirligig beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae) where sex and feeding level were controlled and the position of beetles in a polarized group (in a flow tank) was analyzed at 2 different water speeds after exposure to a simulated predator. It was predicted that males and females would balance foraging and predator avoidance needs differently, as suggested by sexual segregation theory and that males might be likely to occupy front positions because of greater energetic needs. We found that in slow water males were more likely to occupy front positions, whereas in fast water females did, suggesting a different trade-off between the sexes in the need to forage versus save energy (draft). Additionally, we found that in slow water it was the hungry males that came to the group's front, whereas hungry females were more likely to move back. These are some of the first observations of the positional complexity with which individuals in congregations display, and several adaptive and nonadaptive explanations for the observed patterns are suggested.},

	abstract = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70\% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.},

This paper provides a short tutorial on how robots are currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR) and discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past eight years. A domain theory of the search activity is formulated. The domain theory consists of two parts: 1) a workflow model identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles in robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a general information flow model of how data from the robot is fused by various team members into information and knowledge. The information flow model also captures the types of situation awareness needed by each agent in the rescue robot system. The article presents a synopsis of the major HRI issues in reducing the number of humans it takes to control a robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging acceptance within the existing social structure.},

	abstract = {The transition from trot to gallop in quadruped mammals has been widely hypothesized to be a strategy to minimize the energetic costs of running. This view, however, has been challenged by some experimental evidence suggesting instead that this transition might be triggered by mechanical cues, and would occur when musculoskeletal stresses reach a certain critical value. All previous experiments to test those hypotheses have used relatively large species and their results, therefore, may not be applicable to small mammals. In this study we evaluated the effect of carrying loads on the locomotor energetics and gait transitions of the rodent Octodon degus running on a treadmill. Metabolic rate and cost of transport increased about 30\% with a 20\% increment in body mass. This increment was higher than expectations based on other mammals, where energy consumption increases in proportion to the added mass, but similar to the response of humans to loads. No abrupt change of energy consumption between gaits was observed and therefore no evidence was found to support the energetic hypothesis. The trot-gallop transition speed did not vary when subjects were experimentally loaded, suggesting that the forces applied to the musculoskeletal system do not trigger gait transition.},

	abstract = {Aircraft densities in terminal areas increase each year, and the risk of collision grows proportionally. The maintenance of clearance between aircraft in this environment sometimes calls for evasive maneuvers, which depend on the relative position and relative velocity of two aircraft. In this study, small-amplitude maneuvers are found for either or both aircraft in near-miss configurations. Using practical low-order dynamics, individual maneuvers are found that maximize the miss distance. These optimal maneuvers combine longitudinal (speed) and normal (lift) accelerations. The signs of the accelerations of both aircraft depend on their magnitudes. An evasive climb maneuver, for example, becomes a dive maneuver if the acceleration amplitude exceeds a certain value. The maximum-miss maneuvers appear to have practical potential, because they can be determined on-line from estimated position data for both aircraft, without consideration of detailed inertial and aerodynamic properties of the aircraft.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach for interactive navigation and planning of multiple agents in crowded scenes with moving obstacles. Our formulation uses a precomputed roadmap that provides macroscopic, global connectivity for wayfinding and combines it with fast and localized navigation for each agent. At runtime, each agent senses the environment independently and computes a collision-free path based on an extended "Velocity Obstacles" concept. Furthermore, our algorithm ensures that each agent exhibits no oscillatory behaviors. We have tested the performance of our algorithm in several challenging scenarios with a high density of virtual agents. In practice, the algorithm performance scales almost linearly with the number of agents and can run at interactive rates on multi-core processors.},

Considering the problem of having a number of UAVs starting from different known initial locations, the issue is to produce 2-D trajectories, formed by successive way-points, with a desirable velocity distribution along each trajectory, aiming at reaching a predetermined target location, while ensuring collision avoidance either with the environmental obstacles or with the UAVs and satisfying specific route and coordination constraints and objectives. The constraints are imposed in order to maximize the probabilities of UAVs survival and mission accomplishment},

This trend, together with the   overwhelming need to upgrade the National Airspace System, has motivated   the Federal Aviation Administration to sponsor the development of   metrics to evaluate "dynamic density" - a proxy for the likelihood of   collision risk. Here we propose and evaluate a mathematical index of   dynamic density, D, that describes collision risk. Although our domain   of investigation is aviation, the logic of D is applicable whenever   objects move in limited spaces. A series of sensitivity analyses   illustrate how D responds to frequently encountered air traffic conflict   situations. We illustrate a use of D that characterizes pilot   performance and efficiency in experimental simulations of free flight   and suggest other human factors applications. This research could be   applied immediately by the traffic management units of en-route air   traffic control centers to reformulate the criterion for the critical   capacity of sectors.},

Planning approaches are well suited for achieving a goal position in known static environments, while real-time obstacle avoidance methods allow reactive motion behavior in dynamic and unknown environments. This paper proposes the global dynamic window approach as a generalization of the dynamic window approach. It combines methods from motion planning and real-time obstacle avoidance to result in a framework that allows robust execution of high-velocity, goal-directed reactive motion for a mobile robot in unknown and dynamic environments. The global dynamic window approach is applicable to nonholonomic and holonomic mobile robots},

Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required. In particular we consider a foraging robot scenario to which we apply probabilistic model checking.},

Thus, the gait simulation of quadrupeds is a requisite step to obtain the stable and energy-efficient gait for the walking machines. In this paper, the definitions of the two gait parameters, phasic difference and duty factor are presented, which can determine the gait of the quadrupeds. Then, several typical gaits of the quadrupeds are analyzed such that the seven standard gaits and corresponding parameters are summarized. Additionally, the variance law of the two parameters, which determine the relationship of gait transition, is analyzed. Furthermore, the quadruped gait derivative spectrum (QGDS) is proposed and the gait definition of the quadrupeds is presented. To minimize the power consumption, the choice criterion of gait, the optimal gait in terms of the motion speed, duty factory, and power consumption for the walking machines, is developed. Last, the continuous variance of the gait is implemented by the simulation of the gait transition from walk to trot, which evaluate the choice criterion and transition of gait.},

Indeed, the majority of people living in a sub-centre work outside their sub-centre of residence. This situation was even more marked in 1999 than it was in 1990. In addition to this, the majority of jobs located in sub-centres are held by non-residents who are generally living further and further from their place of work.},

Multivariate regression analysis is applied to a dataset extracted from the 2006 Census of Canada master file. The results indicate that significant socioeconomic and land use determinants of normal commute distance are also applicable to extreme commute distance. However, land use factors are more instrumental when explaining extreme commute distance. The results suggest that sex, age, occupation type, mode of transportation, migration, employment status, mixed land uses, and job concentration at the place of residence of the worker all explain commute distance. The results from the mixed land use variables shed some light on the importance of smart growth in limiting long commutes.},

It is an attempt to provide a bigger picture of the very diverse, detailed and highly multidisciplinary research in this area. Based on diversely selected research, this paper explains the initiatives for automation in different levels of transportation system with a specific emphasis on the vehicle-level automation. Human factor studies and legal issues are analyzed as well as control algorithms. Drivers' comfort and well being, increased safety, and increased highway capacity are among the most important initiatives counted for automation. However, sometimes these are contradictory requirements. Relying on an analytical survey of the published research, we will try to provide a more clear understanding of the impact of automation/warning systems on each of the above-mentioned factors. The discussion of sensory issues requires a dedicated paper due to its broad range and is not addressed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Many challenging verification problems arise from complex hybrid automata that model decentralized control systems. As an example, we will consider decentralized policies that steer multiple vehicles in a shared environment: properties of safety and liveness, such as collision avoidance and ultimate convergence of all vehicles to their goals, must be verified. To formally verify the behavior of proposed policies, it is desired to identify the broadest class of start and goal configurations, such that safety and liveness would be guaranteed. Simple conditions are proposed to identify such a class: ideally, a formal proof that such conditions are necessary and sufficient for safety and liveness is requested. Unfortunately, in decentralized control frameworks classical approaches are difficult to apply. Hence, probabilistic verification method can be applied to quantify the accuracy and the confidence of the veridicity of the desired predicate. The probabilistic verification method is applied to a recently proposed cooperative and completely decentralized collision avoidance policy for non-holonomic vehicles.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Midair collisions cause loss of life and property and   undermine general aviation; they also represent failures of the   see-and-avoid concept in air traffic control. This study identifies   limitations of the see-and-avoid concept. Methods: Analysis of National   Transportation Safety Board data on 159 U.S. civil aviation midair   collisions and limitations of the see-and-avoid concept. Results: On   average, there were 15.6 midair collisions annually from 1991 through   2000. At least one aircraft was maneuvering in 88\% of collisions, and   both in 70\%. There were 77\% that involved arrival to, departure from, or   flight over an airport, with 61\% in the traffic pattern. Head-tail   collisions were more frequent in the traffic pattern than out (28.3\%,   2.8\%, p {\textless} 0.05). Other horizontal convergence angles were equally   frequent in or out of the pattern: head-on (8.3\%, 11.0\%), obtuse (11.0\%,   8.3\%), and acute (13.8\%, 16.6\%). Discussion: Because the relative   bearing to each aircraft on an unaccelerated collision course is   constant, pilots sometimes cannot see converging aircraft when climbing,   descending, or level. Even if a converging aircraft is unobstructed, it   appears small, motionless, camouflaged, and inconspicuous until imminent   impact. A statistical model reveals that the probabilities of seeing and   avoiding a converging 40-ft aircraft, for an optimal observer or   theoretical pilot scanning 2/3 or 1/3 of the time, respectively, are   less than 0.91, 0.60, 0.30 at 200 kn; 0.49, 0.32, 0.16 at 300 kn; 0.28,   0.18, 0.09 at 400 kn; and 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 at 500 kn. The see-and-avoid   concept has striking physical and behavioral limitations.},

The field of parallel and distributed simulation has grown over the past fifteen years to accommodate the need of simulating the complex models using a distributed versus sequential method. In particular, asynchronous parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) has been widely studied, and yet we envision greater acceptance of this methodology as more readers are exposed to PDES introductions that carefully integrate real-world applications. With this in mind, we present two key methodologies (conservative and optimistic) which have been adopted as solutions to PDES systems. We discuss PDES terminology and methodology under the umbrella of the personal communications services application},

The transition between swimming and terrestrial walking was examined by videotaping individual Taricha walking both up and down a ramp, inclined at 15° to the horizontal, that had its lower end immersed in water and its upper end out of the water. When ascending the ramp, California newts first approached it by swimming, then used their limbs to walk while still in water, and finally left the water using a normal terrestrial walking gait. The reverse of this sequence was observed when individuals descended the ramp. In both directions, Taricha used a lateral sequence walk with a duty factor of approximately 76\% when out of the water. Timing of footfalls was more variable in water and featured shorter duty factors, leading to periods of suspension. Comparison of angular and timing variables revealed effects due to direction and degree of immersion. Few timing variables showed differences according to stride within sequence (indicating whether the animal was in or out of the water), suggesting that the basic walking pattern is equally good in both environments.},

	doi = {10.1109/FUZZY.2005.1452366},
	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of how to make a UAV track a given flight trajectory while at the same time avoid unexpected obstacle(s). If the information about the existence of the obstacle is known in advance, the problem can be readily solved by carefully pre-planning the desired flight path for the vehicle. However, obstacle(s) might appear unexpectedly in practical applications, as such the pre-planned flight path might become "misleading" to the vehicle if no correcting action is taken. Furthermore, obstacles might be of any shape (not necessarily a point mass) and might be either inert or hostile (including seeking a collision). How to avoid unexpected, irregular, even moving obstacles while maintaining close path tracking of UAV is an interesting yet challenging problem. In this paper, we explore fuzzy logic based approach to path tracking and obstacle avoidance. We consider the case that obstacles are either still or moving and appear along the predetermined flight path unexpectedly. By using suitable sensors we identify the relative distance between the vehicle and the obstacle and make timely adjustment to the pre-planned flight path. Fuzzy logic control algorithms are developed to achieve close path tracking while avoiding obstacles. Simulation studies on multiple obstacles with various shapes are conducted and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified},

	abstract = {While high-quality books and journals in this field continue to proliferate, none has yet come close to matching the Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, which in its first edition, quickly became the definitive reference work in its field. But with the rapid growth of the discipline and the many advances made over the past seven years, it's time to bring this standard-setting reference up to date.Editors Jacob E. Goodman and Joseph O'Rourke reassembled their stellar panel of contributors, added manymore, and together thoroughly revised their work to make the most important results and methods, both classic and cutting-edge, accessible in one convenient volume. Now over more then 1500 pages, the Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, Second Edition once again provides unparalleled, authoritative coverage of theory, methods, and applications.Highlights of the Second Edition:  Thirteen new chapters: Five on applications and others on collision detection, nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces, curve and surface reconstruction, embeddings of finite metric spaces, polygonal linkages, the discrepancy method, and geometric graph theory Thorough revisions of all remaining chapters Extended coverage of computational geometry software, now comprising two chapters: one on the LEDA and CGAL libraries, the other on additional software Two indices: An Index of Defined Terms and an Index of Cited Authors Greatly expanded bibliographies},
