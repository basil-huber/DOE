With a high use of a shared environment by many autonomous entities, such as Personal Aerial Vehicles sharing a portion of the sky, the risk of collisions increases quadratically as function of the density~\cite{jardin_analytical_2005}. Therefore there is a strong need for collision avoidance strategies in those environments. When humans are on-board, safety and comfort become main objectives of the design process. We use a model of flocking for birds and address the effect of the parameters on the travel time as well as on the Jerk.
